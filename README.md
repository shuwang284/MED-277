Project 1: Training GPT from Scratch on Discharge Summaries
^This project walked through a slightly modified version of this huggingface tutorial on training GPT from scratch: https://huggingface.co/learn/llm-course/en/chapter7/6. We explored how training on a small corpus of discharge summaries affects the embeddings and generations of our model.^
^Preview seems to be unavailable. Google Colab automatically adds widget metadata to notebooks, but this metadata is incomplete and not compatible with GitHub’s renderer. As a result, GitHub cannot parse the notebook JSON and shows an “Invalid Notebook” error.^
